# Music Streaming Platform Database Architecture

## Overview

This project implements a comprehensive database system for a music streaming platform using a hybrid approach with PostgreSQL for relational data and MongoDB for document-based data. The architecture is designed to handle millions of users, songs, and billions of streaming events efficiently.

## Architecture Design

### Hybrid Database Approach

The system uses two complementary databases:

- **PostgreSQL**: Handles structured, relational data that benefits from ACID properties
- **MongoDB**: Manages document-based data with flexible schemas and high-volume analytics

### Data Distribution Strategy

| Data Type | Database | Reason |
|-----------|----------|--------|
| Users, Subscriptions | PostgreSQL | Strong consistency, complex relationships |
| Music Library, Statistics | MongoDB | Flexible schema, high write volume |
| Playlists Metadata | PostgreSQL | Relational integrity, permissions |
| Playlist Content | MongoDB | Flexible track ordering, frequent updates |
| Recommendations | MongoDB | Complex nested data, rapid iteration |

## Database Schemas

### PostgreSQL Schema

#### Core Tables

1. **users**: User profiles and authentication
2. **subscription_plans**: Available subscription tiers
3. **user_subscriptions**: User subscription management
4. **playlists**: Playlist metadata and permissions
5. **user_follows**: Social connections between users
6. **playlist_collaborators**: Collaborative playlist permissions
7. **user_preferences**: User settings and preferences

#### Key Features

- UUID primary keys for scalability
- Automatic timestamp triggers
- Comprehensive indexes for performance
- Foreign key constraints for data integrity
- Check constraints for data validation

### MongoDB Schema

#### Core Collections

1. **artists**: Artist profiles and metadata
2. **albums**: Album information and organization
3. **songs**: Complete music library with audio features
4. **playlist_tracks**: Flexible playlist content management
5. **user_statistics**: Detailed listening analytics
6. **user_recommendations**: Personalized recommendation engine
7. **user_activity**: User behavior tracking

#### Key Features

- JSON Schema validation
- Compound indexes for complex queries
- Denormalized data for performance
- Flexible audio feature analysis
- Real-time analytics support

## System Capabilities

## Performance Optimizations

### PostgreSQL Optimizations

- Strategic indexing on frequently queried columns
- Partial indexes for filtered queries
- Automatic timestamp updates with triggers
- Query optimization for subscription analytics

### MongoDB Optimizations

- Compound indexes for complex aggregation queries
- Denormalized artist/song names for faster lookups
- Time-based partitioning for statistics collections
- Efficient aggregation pipelines for analytics

## Use Cases

### Primary Use Cases

1. **Music Streaming**: Efficient song delivery and playback tracking
2. **Playlist Management**: Flexible playlist creation and collaboration
3. **Social Discovery**: User connections and music sharing
4. **Subscription Management**: Revenue optimization and user lifecycle
5. **Content Discovery**: Personalized recommendations and trending content
6. **Analytics Dashboard**: Real-time insights into user behavior and content performance

### Advanced Use Cases

1. **A/B Testing**: Recommendation algorithm testing and optimization
2. **Content Moderation**: Explicit content filtering based on user preferences
3. **Revenue Analytics**: Subscription conversion and churn analysis
4. **Artist Insights**: Performance metrics and audience analysis
5. **Trend Analysis**: Music trend identification and prediction

## Data Flow Examples

### New User Registration

1. **PostgreSQL**: Insert user profile, preferences, and initial subscription
2. **MongoDB**: Create user activity profile and initialize recommendations
3. **Cross-Reference**: Use user UUID to link data across databases

### Song Play Event

1. **MongoDB**: Record detailed listening statistics with audio features
2. **PostgreSQL**: Update playlist play counts if applicable
3. **Analytics**: Trigger recommendation engine updates

### Playlist Creation

1. **PostgreSQL**: Create playlist metadata with permissions
2. **MongoDB**: Initialize empty playlist_tracks collection
3. **Integration**: Use playlist UUID for cross-database references

## Scalability Considerations

### Horizontal Scaling

- **PostgreSQL**: Read replicas for user queries, write master for transactions
- **MongoDB**: Sharding by user_id for statistics and recommendations
- **Connection Pooling**: Efficient database connection management

### Vertical Scaling

- **Memory Optimization**: Adequate RAM for active user sessions and hot data
- **Storage Optimization**: SSD for frequently accessed data, archival for historical data
- **CPU Optimization**: Multi-core processing for complex aggregation queries

## Security Features

- **Password Hashing**: Bcrypt with salt for secure password storage
- **Data Validation**: JSON Schema validation in MongoDB
- **Access Control**: Role-based permissions in PostgreSQL
- **Audit Trail**: Comprehensive user activity logging
- **Data Encryption**: At-rest and in-transit encryption support

## Monitoring & Maintenance

### Key Metrics

- **User Engagement**: Daily/monthly active users, session duration
- **Content Performance**: Song popularity, skip rates, completion rates
- **System Performance**: Query response times, database load
- **Business Metrics**: Subscription conversion, revenue per user

### Maintenance Tasks

- **Index Optimization**: Regular index analysis and optimization
- **Data Archival**: Historical data management and cleanup
- **Performance Tuning**: Query optimization and resource allocation
- **Backup & Recovery**: Automated backup strategies and disaster recovery

This architecture provides a robust foundation for a modern music streaming platform, balancing performance, scalability, and feature richness while maintaining data integrity and user experience.
